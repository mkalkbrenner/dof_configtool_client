# DOF Configtool Client

This is a client for downloading your config files from http://configtool.vpuniverse.com and for applying additional tweaks to them.

It's still work in progress.

The client is written in PHP because of the fact that the configtool itself is written in PHP.
And I want to ease an adoption of features by the configtool itself.

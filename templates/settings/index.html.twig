    <h2>Port Assignments</h2>
    <p>
        The port settings are not required to download and tweak your DOF configs. But they will be required if you want
        to manage your DOFLinks configuration, too. Once you downloaded your "DOF Configuration" and the "Database" the
        autodetection of the port assignments should work.
